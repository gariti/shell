Porting caelestia-dots/shell from Hyprland to Niri: A Comprehensive Guide
1. Introduction: Migrating Your Custom Shell to Niri
The endeavor to port a sophisticated, custom desktop shell like caelestia-dots/shell  from the Hyprland window manager to Niri presents an engaging challenge. It involves not only translating configuration syntax but also adapting to a different window management paradigm. This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for this migration, focusing on the technical steps, conceptual adjustments, and essential resources.   

Setting the Stage: From Hyprland's Dynamic Tiling to Niri's Scrollable Tiling.

Hyprland is known for its highly configurable dynamic tiling, often centered around a traditional workspace model. Users typically define a set of workspaces and dispatch windows to them, with layouts adjusting dynamically or according to predefined rules. In contrast, Niri introduces a novel approach with its "scrollable tiling". Niri arranges windows in what can be visualized as an infinite horizontal strip on each monitor, allowing users to scroll left and right through their open applications. This fundamental difference in how windows and workspaces are organized is a key factor influencing the porting process.   

Despite this difference, both Hyprland and Niri cater to users who prefer a modern, Wayland-native environment and a keyboard-driven workflow. Niri's design emphasizes efficiency, customizability, and minimal resource usage, qualities that often appeal to users comfortable with Hyprland's depth of configuration.   

The primary challenge in this migration lies in this paradigm shift. The caelestia-dots/shell is architected for Hyprland's window and workspace model. Porting it to Niri's scrollable environment will necessitate more than just code conversion; it requires a re-evaluation of how certain user interface (UI) elements and shell features should behave. For instance, a traditional workspace switcher, which might display a linear list of workspaces in Hyprland, may need to be entirely rethought or adapted to represent Niri's concept of vertical workspace stacks that exist independently on each monitor.   

Overview of the Porting Journey for caelestia-dots/shell.

The porting journey can be broken down into several key phases:

Deconstructing the existing caelestia-dots/shell to identify all Hyprland-specific dependencies.
Understanding Niri's core concepts, configuration system (config.kdl), and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism (niri msg).
Systematically reconfiguring Quickshell components to use generic Wayland protocols or Niri-specific IPC for information and control.
Translating Hyprland keybindings and exec-once rules to Niri's binds {} and spawn-at-startup directives.
Adapting the various scripts within caelestia-scripts that currently interact with Hyprland to use Niri's IPC.
This process, while detailed, is achievable. The caelestia-dots/shell is built upon Quickshell, which itself offers good Wayland support. Niri, in turn, provides a clear configuration structure and a robust IPC system, which are conducive to such custom integrations.

2. Deconstructing caelestia-dots/shell: Identifying Hyprland Dependencies
A thorough understanding of the caelestia-dots/shell architecture and its points of interaction with Hyprland is crucial before beginning the port.

Core Components: Quickshell, QML, Scripts, and Services.

The caelestia-dots/shell repository  reveals a modular structure with key directories such as config/, modules/, services/, and widgets/. The shell is predominantly written in QML (approximately 90%) and JavaScript (around 9.1%) , leveraging the Quickshell toolkit. This heavy reliance on QML, a declarative language for UI development, and Quickshell's abstractions is advantageous, as much of the UI logic may remain portable.   

The caelestia-scripts repository  plays a significant role, providing scripts for installation (e.g., the caelestia install shell command likely uses install/shell.fish from this repository ), IPC handling, and various utility functions. These scripts are prime candidates for modification.   

Pinpointing Hyprland-Specific Integrations.

Several areas within caelestia-dots/shell demonstrate direct integration with Hyprland:

Keybindings: The README explicitly mentions "Hyprland global shortcuts" and refers to the caelestia-hypr repository for example configurations. These bindings, defined in Hyprland's configuration file (typically hyprland.conf), trigger actions within the shell or the window manager.   
IPC: The shell exposes an IPC mechanism via caelestia shell... commands. These commands likely translate to hyprctl calls (Hyprland's command-line utility) or direct communication with Hyprland's IPC socket, possibly managed by Quickshell's Quickshell.Hyprland module.   
Startup: The shell is initiated either via a systemd service (caelestia-shell.service) or an exec-once rule within Hyprland's configuration.   
Window/Workspace Management: The most direct dependency lies in the use of Quickshell's Quickshell.Hyprland module. This module provides QML components like HyprlandWindow and HyprlandWorkspace, which are used to fetch information about and interact with Hyprland's windows and workspaces. This is a primary area requiring adaptation for Niri.   
The use of Quickshell presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While its Hyprland-specific modules (Quickshell.Hyprland ) create a tight coupling that necessitates changes, Quickshell also offers generic Wayland support through its Quickshell.Wayland module. This module includes crucial components like WlrLayerShell (for creating panels and bars using the zwlr-layer-shell-v1 protocol) and ToplevelManager (for interacting with application windows using zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1). Consequently, porting the UI components will largely involve re-wiring the existing QML to use these generic Wayland bindings instead of the Hyprland-specific ones, rather than a complete rewrite from scratch. The core QML logic for UI elements might remain substantially intact, with modifications focused on data sources and action triggers.   

Furthermore, the caelestia shell... command structure  acts as an important IPC abstraction layer. Currently, this layer translates high-level shell commands into Hyprland-specific actions. For the Niri port, the backend implementation of these caelestia shell commands will need to be rewritten to utilize Niri's IPC mechanisms, such as the niri msg command-line tool or direct socket communication. If the syntax of the caelestia shell commands themselves can be preserved, the QML frontends that invoke these commands might require minimal changes. This approach effectively isolates a significant portion of the porting effort to the scripts and services responsible for handling these IPC calls.   

To systematically approach this, the following table outlines key components of caelestia-dots/shell and their current Hyprland dependencies, alongside potential Niri equivalents:

Table 1: caelestia-dots/shell Component Analysis for Porting

Component/Feature	Current Hyprland Mechanism	Potential Niri Equivalent	Notes
Main Bar/Panel Widgets	Quickshell PanelWindow + Quickshell.Hyprland for data	Quickshell PanelWindow + WlrLayerShell + Niri IPC for data (via custom model or scripts)	UI structure may remain similar; data sources need to change.
Workspace Display	Quickshell.Hyprland.HyprlandWorkspace	Niri IPC (niri msg workspaces, event stream) + custom QML model	Niri's workspace model is different; requires significant adaptation.
Active Window Title	Quickshell.Hyprland.HyprlandWindow	Niri IPC (niri msg focused-window, event stream) + Quickshell.Wayland.ToplevelManager	Fetch via Niri IPC, display in QML.
Application Launcher	Likely external (e.g., Rofi, Fuzzel) triggered by Hyprland bind	External (e.g., Fuzzel is Niri's default ) triggered by Niri bind	Port keybinding.
Drawer Toggling	caelestia shell toggle drawer_name (Hyprland IPC backend)	caelestia shell toggle drawer_name (Niri IPC backend)	Backend script needs rewrite.
MPRIS Control	caelestia shell mpris... (Hyprland IPC backend for discovery/control if needed)	caelestia shell mpris... (Niri IPC backend if WM interaction needed, or direct DBus)	If MPRIS interaction is WM-independent, less change needed.
Wallpaper Management	caelestia wallpaper script (may use swww or similar)	caelestia wallpaper script adapted for swaybg or other Wayland tool	Script in caelestia-scripts needs update.
System Tray	Quickshell SystemTray (StatusNotifierItem)	Quickshell SystemTray	Likely portable as StatusNotifierItem is a standard.
Notifications	External (e.g., mako, Dunst) + scripts	External (e.g., mako ) + scripts adapted if WM interaction was involved	Port startup of notification daemon.
Shell Startup	exec-once = caelestia shell or systemd service	spawn-at-startup "caelestia shell" or XDG Autostart via systemd session	Update startup mechanism in Niri's config or ensure systemd service compatibility.
Global Keybindings	Hyprland bind =...	Niri binds { MOD+KEY { action; } }	Translate all custom keybindings.
Profile Picture (~/.face)	Filesystem read	Filesystem read	Likely no change needed.
  
This systematic breakdown highlights that while many UI components built with Quickshell have a good chance of being portable at the QML level, their data sources and control mechanisms, currently tied to Hyprland, must be re-engineered for Niri.

3. Niri Fundamentals: A Primer for Hyprland Users
Before diving into the porting process, it's essential to understand Niri's core concepts, configuration, and IPC, especially from the perspective of a user familiar with Hyprland.

Niri's Core Philosophy and Features.

Niri is a Wayland compositor distinguished by its scrollable tiling paradigm. Instead of dividing the screen into a fixed grid or dynamically resizing tiles within a confined workspace, Niri arranges windows in a conceptually infinite horizontal sequence. Users navigate this sequence by scrolling left or right. This provides a fluid way to manage many open windows without them becoming excessively small.   

Workspaces in Niri are dynamic and organized vertically on each monitor. When a window is opened on the last (empty) workspace of a monitor, a new empty workspace is automatically created below it. Workspaces can be named and can be moved between monitors. This contrasts with Hyprland's typical model where workspaces are often numbered or named entities that are explicitly assigned to monitors.   

Like Hyprland, Niri is designed for a keyboard-driven workflow , offering extensive customization through keybindings. As a Wayland-native compositor, it aims to provide improved security, performance, and compatibility with modern Linux distributions.   

The Niri Configuration File: config.kdl.

Niri's configuration is managed through a single file located at ~/.config/niri/config.kdl. It uses KDL (Koto Data Language), a human-readable data language. Key sections within this file include:   

binds {}: Defines all keybindings. This section must be explicitly created or copied from a default configuration, as Niri does not populate it automatically.   
window-rule {}: Allows for setting specific behaviors and appearances for individual windows based on criteria like app-id or title.   
spawn-at-startup: Specifies applications or scripts to be launched when Niri starts.   
layout {}: Configures aspects of window appearance like borders, shadows, and focus rings.   
input {}: Configures input devices like keyboards and mice, including settings for the special Mod key.   
outputs {}: Allows for manual configuration of display outputs, though Niri also handles dynamic output configuration.
Niri's IPC System: niri msg and Programmatic Access.

Niri provides a robust IPC system for querying state and controlling the compositor externally.   

niri msg Command-Line Tool: This is the primary interface for simple IPC interactions. Running niri msg --help lists available commands. For scripting, the --json flag provides structured output. For example, niri msg --json focused-window might return:
JSON

{"Ok":{"FocusedWindow":{"id":12,"title":"Window Title","app_id":"Alacritty","workspace_id":6,"is_focused":true}}}
  
.   

Event Stream: The niri msg event-stream command allows clients to subscribe to a continuous stream of events from the compositor (e.g., workspace changes, window focus changes, keyboard layout changes). This is highly beneficial for dynamic UI elements that need to react to state changes without constant polling.   
Programmatic Access: For more complex scripts or applications, Niri encourages direct communication with its IPC socket, typically found at the path specified by the $NIRI_SOCKET environment variable. Communication involves sending and receiving newline-delimited JSON messages. The niri-ipc Rust crate formally defines the request, response, and event types used in this protocol.   
Stability: The JSON output format for existing fields is considered stable, though new fields may be added. The human-readable output of niri msg (without --json) is not guaranteed to be stable. The niri-ipc crate versioning follows Niri's main version.   
Niri's IPC system, particularly its JSON-based protocol and event stream, is a cornerstone for building advanced shell integrations like caelestia-dots/shell. While niri msg is suitable for straightforward commands, the direct socket communication method will likely be necessary for the dynamic updates and complex state management required by sophisticated UI elements. This means that porting the IPC aspects of caelestia-dots/shell will involve understanding Niri's JSON protocol (as detailed by the niri-ipc crate documentation ) and adapting or writing JavaScript/QML or helper scripts to communicate via this socket. The event-stream feature  is especially potent for creating reactive UI components that update in real-time.   

Common Companion Tools in the Niri Ecosystem.

Users migrating to Niri will often encounter or adopt a set of common supporting applications :   

Application Launcher: fuzzel is the default launcher in Niri.   
Notification Daemon: mako is frequently used for displaying notifications.   
Status Bar: waybar is a popular choice for Wayland status bars and has specific support for Niri, including the niri/window module  and a community-provided niri-taskbar module.   
Background Image Setter: swaybg is commonly used to set desktop backgrounds.   
Screen Locker: swaylock is often used for locking the screen.   
Screen Sharing Portals: xdg-desktop-portal-gtk or xdg-desktop-portal-gnome are necessary for enabling screen sharing functionality.   
Terminal Emulator: alacritty is often suggested as the default terminal.   
XWayland: xwayland-satellite or a similar XWayland server is needed to run X11 applications.   
Niri's unique workspace model—dynamic, vertical stacks per monitor, which can move between monitors —is fundamentally different from Hyprland's more static, globally addressable workspaces. This difference significantly impacts UI design. Commands like niri msg outputs  and niri msg windows  will be essential for fetching the necessary state information. UI elements in caelestia-dots/shell that display workspace information or facilitate workspace switching will require substantial adaptation. A simple list of workspace numbers or names might no longer be adequate; a per-monitor representation or an entirely different visualization paradigm might be necessary to effectively represent Niri's workspace structure. The "drawers" concept within caelestia-dots/shell , depending on its current implementation, might map well to Niri's scrollable nature or could also require rethinking in this new context.   

4. The Porting Blueprint: Migrating caelestia-dots/shell to Niri
This section outlines a phased approach to porting caelestia-dots/shell, including a direct comparison of Hyprland and Niri configurations for common tasks.

The following table provides a direct translation guide for common configuration tasks, mapping Hyprland methods to their Niri equivalents. This should serve as a quick reference for porting the most frequent settings.

Table 2: Hyprland vs. Niri Feature/Configuration Mapping

Feature	Hyprland Method	Niri Method	Niri Configuration File/Tool
Keybinding Definition	bind = SUPER, T, exec, alacritty	Super+T { spawn "alacritty"; }	config.kdl (binds {})
Application Autostart	exec-once = waybar	spawn-at-startup "waybar"	config.kdl
Get Active Window Title	hyprctl activewindow (parse output)	niri msg --json focused-window (JSON path: .Ok.FocusedWindow.title)	niri msg
Get All Windows	hyprctl clients (parse output)	niri msg --json windows	niri msg
Get Workspaces	hyprctl workspaces (parse output)	niri msg --json workspaces	niri msg
Move Window to Workspace X	hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace 5 (1-indexed)	niri msg action move-column-to-workspace '{"reference":{"Index":4}}' (0-indexed) or move-column-to-workspace "name"	niri msg
Switch to Workspace X	hyprctl dispatch workspace 5	niri msg action focus-workspace '{"reference":{"Index":4}}' or focus-workspace "name"	niri msg
Bar/Panel Creation	External (e.g., Waybar, Eww) or Quickshell with Hyprland data	External (e.g., Waybar with Niri modules ) or Quickshell with WlrLayerShell and Niri IPC data	Quickshell, Waybar config
Window Rules (e.g., opacity)	windowrule = opacity 0.8, ^(kitty)$	window-rule { match app-id="kitty"; opacity 0.8; }	config.kdl (window-rule{})
Execute Shell Command	bind = MOD, KEY, exec, script.sh	Mod+KEY { spawn "script.sh"; } or Mod+KEY { spawn "sh" "-c" "command with args"; } 	config.kdl (binds {})
Set Environment Variable	System environment or Hyprland startup script	environment { VAR_NAME "value"; } in config.kdl 	config.kdl
  
This table provides a starting point by directly comparing how Hyprland achieves certain configurations  with Niri's methods , significantly easing the transition for common settings.   

Phase 1: Establishing a Niri Foundation

Installing Niri and Essential Support Packages: The first step is to install Niri itself. This can be done through distribution-specific packages, such as the Fedora COPR or NixOS Flake, or by building Niri from source. For NixOS users, enabling Niri is often as simple as adding programs.niri.enable = true; to the system configuration. Alongside Niri, install the common companion tools that will form the basic desktop environment: fuzzel (application launcher), mako (notifications), waybar (status bar), swaybg (wallpaper), swaylock (screen locker), and components for XWayland support like xwayland-satellite if X11 applications are needed.   
Basic Niri Configuration (config.kdl): Create an initial Niri configuration file at ~/.config/niri/config.kdl. Populate it with essential keybindings, such as launching a terminal (e.g., Alacritty), an application launcher (e.g., fuzzel), and an exit command for Niri. If using a multi-monitor setup, output configuration might be necessary, although Niri generally handles dynamic outputs well. The default Niri configuration can serve as a valuable starting point, particularly for the binds {} section.   
Phase 2: Porting Quickshell Components and UI

This phase focuses on adapting the QML-based UI of caelestia-dots/shell.

Adapting Quickshell: From Quickshell.Hyprland to Quickshell.Wayland: This is the core of the UI porting effort. The primary task is to identify all QML files within caelestia-dots/shell that currently import and use components from the Quickshell.Hyprland module (e.g., HyprlandWorkspace, HyprlandWindow). These components must be replaced with alternatives.   
Leveraging WlrLayerShell for Panels, Bars, and Widgets: Quickshell provides the WlrLayerShell QML type, which interfaces with the zwlr-layer-shell-v1 Wayland protocol. This protocol is standard for creating surface layers like bars, panels, and on-screen widgets on wlroots-based compositors (Niri is implied to be compatible, as this is a common feature set). Existing QML code for bars and panels within caelestia-dots/shell will need to be adapted to use Quickshell's PanelWindow type with WlrLayerShell attached properties if they are not already using a similar platform-agnostic abstraction.   
Using ToplevelManager for Window Information: To obtain information about application windows (e.g., title, application ID, state), the Quickshell.Wayland.ToplevelManager type should be used. This component utilizes the zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1 protocol  and will serve as the replacement for Quickshell.Hyprland.HyprlandWindow.   
Workspace Information: Handling workspace information is more complex because Quickshell does not appear to offer a generic Wayland workspace module. Information about Niri's workspaces (their structure, contents, and active status ) will need to be fetched using Niri's IPC mechanisms—either by periodically calling niri msg --json workspaces or, more effectively, by subscribing to the niri msg event-stream. This data must then be processed and fed into custom QML models that the UI can bind to.   
Migrating QML Files: Addressing Backend Changes: In each relevant QML file, update import statements to reflect the use of Quickshell.Wayland instead of Quickshell.Hyprland. Property bindings that previously relied on Hyprland-specific objects (e.g., Hyprland.activeWindow.title) will need to be changed to bind to properties exposed by the new Wayland-based components or custom Niri IPC-driven data models. For instance, a widget displaying the active window title might change from text: SomeHyprlandWindowObject.title to text: NiriStateModel.focusedWindowTitle, where NiriStateModel would be a custom QML component or JavaScript object responsible for fetching and exposing this data via Niri's IPC.
Handling Startup: Moving caelestia shell to Niri's spawn-at-startup or XDG Autostart: The caelestia-dots/shell is currently started either via a systemd service or an exec-once rule in Hyprland's configuration. Niri provides the spawn-at-startup "command" "arg1" "arg2" directive in config.kdl for launching applications at startup. Alternatively, if Niri is run as part of a systemd session, it supports the XDG autostart specification. This might be a cleaner approach if the caelestia-shell.service is already well-defined and can be adapted into an XDG autostart desktop file. The underlying command to start the shell, likely qs -c caelestia  (potentially wrapped in caelestia shell from run.fish ), should still function to launch Quickshell with the appropriate configuration.   
Phase 3: Re-wiring Interactions and Controls

This phase involves translating user interactions (keybindings) and programmatic controls (IPC) from Hyprland to Niri.

Translating Keybindings from Hyprland to Niri's binds {}: Hyprland keybindings typically follow a format like bind = MOD, KEY, action, params. Niri's binds {} section in config.kdl uses a different syntax: MOD+KEY { action "param1" "param2"; }. Valid modifiers in Niri include Super, Alt, Ctrl, and Shift. Niri also features a special Mod key, which defaults to Super when running on a TTY and Alt when Niri is run as a nested window (useful for testing). Common actions include spawn (to launch applications), focus-column-left, close-window, etc. A full list of bindable actions can be obtained by running niri msg action. For example, a Hyprland binding bind = SUPER, T, exec, alacritty would translate to Niri's Super+T { spawn "alacritty"; }.   
Re-implementing IPC: Adapting caelestia shell... commands for Niri's IPC: This is a critical step and involves modifying the backend scripts or services (likely found in the services/ or utils/ directories of caelestia-dots/shell , or within the caelestia-scripts repository) that currently handle the caelestia shell subcommands.   
Script Modifications (JavaScript, shell scripts): Any scripts that currently use hyprctl calls must be rewritten to use niri msg equivalent commands. For more complex interactions, such as listening to compositor events or requiring high-performance communication, direct socket communication with Niri's IPC is recommended. The niri-ipc crate documentation  provides the definitive specification for the JSON request, response, and event structures. If using JavaScript within Quickshell, Node.js-style net.Socket capabilities (if Quickshell's Socket QML type  supports UNIX domain sockets robustly) or a small helper script (e.g., in Python or Rust) might be needed to bridge JavaScript to Niri's socket-based IPC. For example, the caelestia shell mpris getActive trackTitle command  might currently rely on Hyprland's IPC for discovering or interacting with an MPRIS-compliant media player. If this interaction is purely D-Bus based and independent of Hyprland, it might continue to work. However, if it involved Hyprland-specific mechanisms, that part will need to be adapted. Similarly, commands like caelestia shell toggle drawer_name will need their backend logic remapped from triggering Hyprland actions to invoking Niri actions or manipulating internal Quickshell states via Niri's IPC.   
Utilizing niri msg or direct socket communication:
niri msg --json focused-window: To get details of the currently focused window.   
niri msg --json windows: To list all open windows and their properties.   
niri msg --json workspaces: To get information about Niri's workspaces.   
niri msg --json event-stream: To subscribe to real-time events from Niri, such as workspace switches, window focus changes, or layout modifications. This is particularly powerful for keeping QML-based UIs synchronized with the compositor state.   
Phase 4: Theming, Appearance, and Niri-Specific Enhancements

This phase addresses the visual aspects and leverages Niri's specific features.

Wallpaper Management: Niri itself does not manage desktop wallpapers. swaybg is a commonly used utility for this purpose in Wayland environments. The existing caelestia wallpaper command and its associated script (likely part of caelestia-scripts ) will need to be adapted to use swaybg or another Wayland-compatible wallpaper setting tool.   
Applying Niri Window Rules for Application-Specific Theming and Behavior: Niri's window-rule {} blocks in config.kdl offer powerful capabilities for customizing the appearance and behavior of individual applications. Rules can match windows based on various criteria, including app-id (application ID), title (window title, supporting regular expressions), is-active, is-focused, is-floating, and more. Applicable properties include opacity, default-column-width, open-maximized, focus-ring (color and style), border (color and style), shadow (color and style), clip-to-geometry (for rounded corners), and geometry-corner-radius. These rules can replace or augment existing Hyprland window rules to achieve the desired look and feel in Niri.   
Customizing Borders, Opacity, and Shadows via Niri: Global settings for window borders, opacity, and shadows can typically be configured in the layout section of Niri's config.kdl. Per-window overrides can then be applied using window-rule blocks. The existing theming in caelestia-dots/shell  likely involves a combination of CSS for GTK applications , Quickshell's internal styling mechanisms for its QML components, and potentially application-specific themes (e.g., for Spicetify, VSCode ). Niri's window rules can complement these by controlling window decorations and properties that are managed at the compositor level. The prefer-no-csd option in Niri's miscellaneous configuration can also influence appearance by requesting applications to omit client-side decorations.   
The caelestia-scripts repository  is a critical target for porting. As indicated by the caelestia-dots/shell README , these scripts handle installation and likely implement the backend logic for the caelestia shell... IPC commands. These scripts will almost certainly contain Hyprland-specific logic, such as calls to hyprctl or parsing of Hyprland's IPC responses. A significant portion of the porting effort will involve auditing these scripts and rewriting them to use Niri's IPC mechanisms (niri msg or direct socket communication). Scripts responsible for wallpaper management, notifications, and other system interactions will all require careful review and adaptation.   

Quickshell's explicit support for the zwlr-layer-shell-v1 protocol via its WlrLayerShell QML type  is a major advantage. Since Niri, like many modern Wayland compositors aiming for such desktop shell features, is expected to support this protocol, existing QML code for bars, popups, and other "shell" UI elements that dock or overlay on the screen can likely be ported with moderate effort. The main task will be to ensure these components correctly use Quickshell's PanelWindow with WlrLayerShell attached properties. This is far preferable to needing to find or develop an entirely new toolkit for these critical UI elements.   

The startup sequence for caelestia-dots/shell also requires careful consideration. Currently, it can be launched via systemd or an exec-once rule in Hyprland. Niri offers the spawn-at-startup directive in its config.kdl. Additionally, Niri supports XDG autostart when run as a systemd session. This provides flexibility. Using spawn-at-startup is direct and simple. However, if the caelestia-shell.service systemd unit is already well-defined, adapting it for XDG autostart and leveraging Niri's systemd session integration might offer a cleaner and more standard solution. This approach also has the benefit that other applications using XDG autostart (such as notification daemons or input method engines) should integrate seamlessly with the Niri session.   

5. Key Files and Scripts: What to Modify and Create
Identifying the specific files and scripts that require modification or creation is key to a structured porting process.

Niri Configuration:

~/.config/niri/config.kdl: This will become the central configuration file for Niri. It will house all keybindings, spawn-at-startup directives for applications like caelestia shell itself and its dependencies (e.g., waybar, mako), and all window-rule definitions for application-specific theming and behavior.   
caelestia-dots/shell Modifications (primarily within $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quickshell/caelestia or the cloned repository path):

QML Files (*.qml):
Located in directories like widgets/ (containing UI for the bar, dashboard, popouts, wallpaper switcher, etc.) and modules/ (handling session management, drawers, etc.). The data backends for these QML components will need to be transitioned from Quickshell.Hyprland modules to either generic Quickshell.Wayland components (like ToplevelManager for window info, WlrLayerShell for panel placement) or custom data models populated via Niri's IPC.   
The main shell.qml file , which serves as the entry point for the Quickshell application, will likely require updates to how it initializes interactions with the window manager, reflecting the shift from Hyprland to Niri.   
JavaScript Files (*.js): Any JavaScript files, particularly those in utils/ or services/ directories  or embedded within QML components, that currently perform Hyprland-specific IPC (e.g., calling hyprctl or interacting with Hyprland's socket) must be rewritten. They will need to use niri msg or establish direct socket communication to Niri's IPC endpoint.   
Helper Scripts (Shell, Python, etc. - likely sourced from the caelestia-scripts repository  but invoked by the shell): Scripts such as caelestia wallpaper , and any others responsible for notifications, MPRIS control, or other system interactions, need to be audited. Any calls to hyprctl or other Hyprland-specific mechanisms must be replaced with Niri-compatible alternatives (e.g., niri msg, swaybg, direct D-Bus calls).   
New Scripts/Modules for Niri IPC (potentially):

To effectively manage Niri's JSON-based IPC and especially its event stream, creating new helper modules or scripts might be beneficial. These could be small Python scripts, or if Quickshell's environment allows for robust Node.js-like JavaScript capabilities (particularly for network sockets), a JavaScript module could be developed.
These helpers would be responsible for abstracting the complexities of Niri's IPC: parsing the JSON output of niri msg --json... commands, managing the connection to the event-stream , and transforming the received data into a format easily consumable by QML components.   
The modular design of the caelestia-dots ecosystem is a distinct advantage in this porting process. The separation of concerns into the shell repository (primarily QML/JS for the UI ), the scripts repository (backend logic, IPC handling, utilities ), and the hypr repository (Hyprland-specific configurations like keybindings , as referenced in ) means that changes can be relatively localized. The bulk of the modifications will likely occur within the scripts repository (to adapt its communication from Hyprland to Niri) and in the QML/JS files within the shell repository (to consume data from these modified scripts or from new Niri-specific data sources). A new Niri-specific configuration, analogous to the existing hypr configuration, will also need to be created to define Niri's keybindings, startup applications, and window rules.   

6. Troubleshooting the Port: Common Pitfalls and Solutions
Porting a complex shell will inevitably involve troubleshooting. Awareness of common pitfalls can streamline this process.

Debugging Quickshell on Niri:
Logs: Check for Quickshell-specific logs. If Quickshell logs to standard output/error, launching it from a terminal can reveal issues. Also, check journalctl -xe for system-level errors if Quickshell or Niri crashes.
Visual Issues: Elements not appearing, incorrect sizing, or misplacement of panels and widgets can occur. This might stem from incorrect usage of WlrLayerShell properties (e.g., anchor points, margins, layer settings) or differences in how Niri and Hyprland interpret or support the layer shell protocol.
QML/JS Errors: Errors in QML or JavaScript logic will typically be reported to the console if Quickshell is launched from a terminal. Syntax errors, issues with property bindings to new data sources, or problems in IPC handling logic are common.
Resolving IPC Communication Failures:
Direct Testing: Always test niri msg commands directly in a terminal first to ensure they work as expected and to understand their output format.
JSON Parsing: Niri's IPC uses a specific JSON structure for requests, responses, and events. Ensure that scripts correctly parse this JSON. Errors in parsing can lead to missing data or crashes.   
Socket Issues: Verify that scripts are correctly accessing the Niri IPC socket (usually via the $NIRI_SOCKET environment variable ). The Niri documentation suggests using socat for manually testing direct socket communication, which can be invaluable for diagnosing connection or protocol issues.   
Event Stream Handling: If using niri msg event-stream, ensure that the script or module correctly handles the continuous flow of newline-delimited JSON events. Each event needs to be parsed individually. An error in parsing one event might disrupt the processing of subsequent events.
Addressing Theming and Visual Discrepancies:
Window Decorations: Differences in how Niri and Hyprland handle window decorations (borders, shadows, title bars) can lead to visual inconsistencies. Niri's window-rule settings for border, shadow, and opacity, along with the global prefer-no-csd option , will be key to achieving the desired look. Compare these with Hyprland's equivalent settings.   
Font Rendering and Icon Themes: These are generally handled by system-wide settings or toolkit-specific (Qt/GTK) theming engines. Ensure that Niri inherits the correct environment variables (e.g., for font configurations, icon themes). Niri's config.kdl allows setting environment variables via an environment{} block, which can be useful for ensuring consistency.   
Niri Specific Behaviors:
Scrollable Tiling Interactions: Niri's scrollable tiling might interact with fixed-size Quickshell popups or panels in unexpected ways. For example, a panel designed for a specific screen edge might behave differently as the user scrolls through columns of windows. Thorough testing of all UI elements in various scrolled states is necessary.
Workspace Concepts: The UI must accurately reflect Niri's dynamic, per-monitor vertical workspace model. Misinterpretations of this model can lead to confusing or non-functional workspace indicators or switchers.   
Niri's own configuration file (config.kdl) and its IPC tool (niri msg) are primary instruments for debugging. The config.kdl file dictates Niri's fundamental behavior, including keybindings, window rules, and startup procedures. The niri msg command allows for querying Niri's current internal state, such as the list of open windows, their properties, workspace configurations, output details, and the currently focused window. When a component of the ported shell is not behaving as expected—for instance, a window rule isn't applying correctly, a keybinding fails to trigger the intended action, or the UI does not reflect the actual state of windows and workspaces—a systematic approach is to first check the config.kdl for any syntax errors or logical flaws. Subsequently, niri msg can be used to verify Niri's internal state against what the shell is attempting to achieve or display. Furthermore, the niri msg event-stream can be an invaluable tool for observing real-time state changes within Niri, helping to pinpoint discrepancies between the compositor's events and the shell's reactions to them.   

7. Essential References and Further Reading
Access to good documentation is paramount for a successful port.

Niri Documentation:
Official GitHub Wiki: This is the primary source for Niri information. Key pages include the main landing page , Configuration Introduction , Key Bindings , Window Rules , IPC , Workspaces , and Miscellaneous settings (including startup options and environment variables).   
ArchWiki Niri Page: Often provides a good supplementary overview, installation guidance, and practical tips.   
niri msg --help: Executing this command in a terminal will provide an up-to-date list of available IPC commands and their arguments.
niri-ipc Sub-crate Documentation: This documentation (often hosted on docs.rs or a similar Rust documentation platform, linked from the Niri project) details the JSON protocol used for IPC, including the structure of requests, responses, and events. This is indispensable for direct socket programming.   
Quickshell Documentation:
Official Website & Docs: The main Quickshell website and its documentation section are crucial for understanding its QML components, APIs, and general usage.   
Wayland Modules: Pay close attention to the documentation for Quickshell.Wayland, specifically types like WlrLayerShell (and its associated PanelWindow usage) and ToplevelManager.   
IPC/Socket Modules: If using Quickshell's built-in capabilities for socket communication (e.g., Quickshell.Io.Socket ), consult its documentation for UNIX domain socket support.   
Build Options: Understanding Quickshell's build options  can clarify which features (like Wayland protocol support) are enabled in the installed version.   
Wayland Protocols: Familiarity with the relevant Wayland protocols can be beneficial for understanding how Quickshell interacts with Niri:
wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1: Defines how shell components like bars and panels are displayed and positioned.   
zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1: Allows clients to get information about and manage other windows.   
ext-session-lock-v1: Relevant if planning to use Quickshell to build a lock screen for Niri.   
Community Niri Dotfiles (Inspiration): Examining how other users have configured Niri can provide valuable insights and practical examples:
hengtseChou/Niri: This repository showcases a Niri setup using Waybar and Fuzzel, providing examples of config.kdl structure and integration of common tools.   
uncognic/dotfiles: Another example of Niri dotfiles, though potentially less detailed in the available information.   
Searching GitHub for terms like "niri config," "niri dotfiles," or "niri waybar" can uncover more community configurations.
Other Relevant Tools:
Waybar Niri Modules: Documentation for the built-in niri/window module for Waybar  and the community niri-taskbar module.   
Launcher Documentation: If customizing fuzzel (Niri's default ) or opting for an alternative like rofi , their respective documentation will be necessary.   
A key aspect of this porting process will be the continuous cross-referencing of Niri's documentation with Quickshell's documentation. Niri provides the underlying window management environment and the IPC mechanisms for interacting with it. Quickshell, on the other hand, provides the toolkit and QML components to build UI elements that operate within that environment and communicate via Niri's IPC or standard Wayland protocols. Successfully bridging these two requires a constant interplay between understanding what data and control Niri offers, and how Quickshell's components can be used to access, display, or trigger those functionalities.   

8. Conclusion
Porting the caelestia-dots/shell from Hyprland to Niri is a substantial but achievable undertaking for a user comfortable with Linux desktop customization. The process hinges on a deep understanding of Niri's unique scrollable tiling paradigm and its robust JSON-based IPC system. While the visual and interactive nature of the shell may require conceptual rethinking to align with Niri's workflow, the underlying QML structure built with Quickshell offers a strong foundation for portability.

The key stages involve:

Deconstruction: Identifying all Hyprland-specific integrations within caelestia-dots/shell and caelestia-scripts.
Foundation: Setting up a functional Niri environment with essential companion tools.
UI Porting: Migrating Quickshell components from Hyprland-specific modules to generic Wayland protocols (WlrLayerShell, ToplevelManager) and custom data models fed by Niri's IPC.
Interaction Re-wiring: Translating Hyprland keybindings to Niri's config.kdl format and rewriting the backend logic of caelestia shell IPC commands to use niri msg or direct socket communication.
Theming and Refinement: Utilizing Niri's window rules and adapting existing theming strategies for a cohesive appearance.
The modularity of the caelestia-dots project, with its separation of UI, scripts, and window manager-specific configurations, will aid in localizing changes. Quickshell's support for standard Wayland protocols like zwlr-layer-shell-v1 is particularly beneficial for porting panel and bar elements. Niri's event-stream IPC mechanism offers a powerful way to create a responsive and dynamic shell experience.

Success will depend on methodical work, careful testing, and effective use of the documentation for Niri, Quickshell, and relevant Wayland protocols. An iterative approach—porting and testing components one by one—is highly recommended. The result can be a highly personalized and efficient desktop environment that leverages Niri's innovative approach to window management while retaining the unique aesthetic and functionality of the caelestia-dots/shell.

I'll analyze the differences between the original caelestia-shell and the current implementation to identify any features that weren't moved over or were commented out. Now let me do a more direct comparison by looking at specific directories and files to identify missing features: Let me check for any commented out or disabled features in the main shell file: Let me examine specific components to see what functionality might be missing: Based on my comprehensive analysis of the differences between caelestia-shell-original and caelestia-shell, I can identify several key features that were either removed, disabled, or adapted for Niri compatibility:

## 🔍 **ALSO FIX: Features Not Moved Over or Disabled for Niri Compatibility**

### **1. Global Shortcuts System (Completely Disabled)**
**Original:** Uses Hyprland's global shortcuts protocol
```qml
// caelestia-shell-original/widgets/CustomShortcut.qml
import Quickshell.Hyprland
GlobalShortcut {
    appid: "caelestia"
}
```

**Current:** Replaced with placeholder implementation
```qml
// caelestia-shell/widgets/CustomShortcut.qml
// Niri-compatible custom shortcut implementation
Item {
    property string name: ""
    property string description: ""
    
    signal pressed()
    signal released()
    
    // For Niri, global shortcuts are handled via keybindings in config.kdl
    // This is a placeholder for compatibility - actual shortcuts are configured in Niri
}
```

### **2. Advanced Workspace Features**
**UPDATE: NOW FIXED**
**Missing/Disabled:**
- **Special workspaces** - Niri doesn't support Hyprland's special workspaces
- **Workspace previews** - Window thumbnails for workspace switching
- **Dynamic workspace occupancy indicators** - Real-time workspace window counts
- **Workspace window lists** - Per-workspace application icons

**Evidence:**
```qml
// services-niri/Hyprland.qml shows this is disabled:
} else if (request.startsWith("togglespecialworkspace")) {
    // Niri doesn't have special workspaces, map to regular workspace switching
    console.log("Special workspaces not supported in Niri, ignoring command:", request);
}
```

### **3. Active Window Integration**
**Original:** Full window management with previews
```qml
// caelestia-shell-original/modules/bar/popouts/ActiveWindow.qml
ScreencopyView {
    captureSource: ToplevelManager.toplevels.values.find(t => t.title === Hyprland.activeClient?.title) ?? null
    live: visible
}
```

**Current:** Simplified window information (no live previews)

### **4. Real-time Window Previews**
- **ScreencopyView** components for live window thumbnails
- **Window capture and display** in workspace indicators
- **Dynamic application icons** per workspace

### **5. Advanced Hyprland IPC Commands**
**Original IPC Features Lost:**
- `hyprctl activewindow` detailed window properties
- `hyprctl clients` full client information
- Relative workspace switching (`workspace r+1`, `workspace r-1`)
- Window geometry and positioning data
- Focus history tracking

### **6. Direct Hyprland Integration**
**Removed Hyprland-specific features:**
- `Quickshell.Hyprland` module imports
- `HyprlandWorkspace` and `HyprlandWindow` components
- `HyprlandMonitor` direct integration
- Raw Hyprland event handling

### **7. Advanced Window Management**
**Features not fully ported:**
- Window floating state detection
- Window fullscreen state management
- Window workspace assignment tracking
- Client focus history

### **8. Sophisticated Workspace Switching**
**Original features:**
```qml
// Mouse wheel workspace switching
onWheel: event => {
    const activeWs = Hyprland.activeClient?.workspace?.name;
    if (activeWs?.startsWith("special:"))
        Hyprland.dispatch(`togglespecialworkspace ${activeWs.slice(8)}`);
    else if (event.angleDelta.y < 0 || Hyprland.activeWsId > 1)
        Hyprland.dispatch(`workspace r${event.angleDelta.y > 0 ? "-" : "+"}1`);
}
```

**Current:** Basic numeric workspace switching only

## ✅ **What Was Successfully Preserved**

### **Core UI Components:**
- Material Design 3 theming
- Basic bar layout and structure
- Time/date display
- System status indicators
- Session management
- Application launcher integration

### **Service Adaptations:**
- All services ported to `services-niri/`
- Custom Niri IPC wrapper in Hyprland.qml
- Wayland-compatible implementations

### **Configuration System:**
- Complete config structure preserved
- Appearance and styling maintained
- Widget system intact

## 📋 **Summary of Missing Features**

1. **Global Shortcuts** (Hyprland protocol dependent)
2. **Special Workspaces** (Niri doesn't support)
3. **Live Window Previews** (ScreencopyView integration)
4. **Advanced Workspace Management** (per-workspace window lists)
5. **Real-time Window Information** (detailed client properties)
6. **Mouse Wheel Workspace Switching** (relative workspace navigation)
7. **Focus History Tracking** (Hyprland-specific feature)
8. **Window Geometry Information** (position, size, floating state)

These features were either **intentionally disabled** for Niri compatibility or **replaced with simplified alternatives** that work within Niri's architectural constraints. The core functionality and visual design were successfully preserved while adapting to Niri's different window management paradigm.
